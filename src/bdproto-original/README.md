# BDPROTO original data

The original source data (and project name) come from Marsico 1999:

```Marsico, Egidio. 1999. What can a database of proto-languages tell us about the last 10,000 years of sound changes. In Proceedings of the XIVth International Congress of Phonetic Sciences (ICPhS99), 353-356. Online:``` [https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/icphs-proceedings/ICPhS1999/papers/p14_0353.pdf](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/icphs-proceedings/ICPhS1999/papers/p14_0353.pdf)

This legacy resource was converted into Unicode UTF-8 using principles defined in [Moran & Cysouw, 2018](https://github.com/unicode-cookbook/cookbook/blob/master/unicode-cookbook.pdf). The original BDPROTO data is available in various formats along with the extraction and transformation scripts at: [https://github.com/bdproto/bdproto-legacy](https://github.com/bdproto/bdproto-legacy). BDPROTO-legacy contains a convenience sample aimed at genealogical diversity and it contains no duplicate inventories for a given reconstruction.

We have also updated the data here so that, when possible, the segments follow the [PHOIBLE conventions](http://phoible.github.io/conventions/) to make the two data sources maximally comparable.
