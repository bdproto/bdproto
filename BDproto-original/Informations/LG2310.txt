Comments:
Sre is spoken in Lam  Dong, Dong Nai and Thuan Hai Provinces is Vietnam. Vowel length and pitch are interdependent, low tone vowels being long.  Manley treats length as conditioning low pitch but the reverse assumption is preferred here.  What are described as "aspirated nasals" are interpreted as voiceless nasals but the phrase might be intended to mean "breathy voiced".  They are written mh, nh, etc., by Manley.
