Comments:
Kolokuma Ijo is spoken on the Nun branch of the Niger delta system in Rivers State, Nigeria. There are two level tones. Vowel harmony separates 'close' vowels /i, e, u, o/ from their more open counterparts; /a/ is neutral. Nasalized vowels preceding stops are pronounced with a consonantal nasal offset homorganic with the stop.
