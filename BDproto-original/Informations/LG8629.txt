Comments:
Yawa is spoken on Yapen island, Irian Jaya, Indonesia. Stress placement is unpredictable. After /u/ the palato-alveolar affricate has the allophone [g]. Nasal + obstruent clusters occur but Jones (1986) reports that they are not homorganic if the obstruent is velar or palato-alveolar, and are phonetically heterosyllabic where intervocalic; hence, even initial cases are analyzed as sequences. Many two-vowel sequences occur.
