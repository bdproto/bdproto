Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Kordofanian

Comments:
Jomang has two level tones, falling tone has been noted in word-final position. All continuants except /n/ and /w/ are reported as geminates in Schadeberg's data. He notes voiced and voiceless stops, but they can be analyzed as only one series, voiced when single and voiceless when geminate this interpretation is preferred.
