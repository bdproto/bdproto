Comments:
Southern Sierra Miwok used to be spoken in Mariposa county, California. In the 1960's there were about 20 speakers living. Stops vary between voiced and voiceless intervocalically. Consonants may be long - Freeland (1951) says geminates only occur medially but Broadbent (1965) indicates they also occur finally.
