Classification: Australian, ungrouped

Comments:
Waray was formerly spoken in the area around Adelaide River, south of Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia.  Harvey (1987) notes that unitary long consonants contrast with sequences of identical consonants.  Short stops are shown as voiced after nasals, and optionally, between vowels.  When intervocalic they may become approximants, or in the case of /t/ a tap.
