Comments:
Khmer ios spoken in Mekong Delta of Southwesten Vietnamand also in Kampuchean and Thailand. Khmer syllables are assigned to one of two 'registers'.  Vowel qualities often differ between registers with some being limited to one or the other.  In careful speech lower pitch and breathy phonation distinguish second from first register, but often only vowel differences remain in more rapid speech.  In addition to the short diphthongs listed there are a number of vowel sequences.
