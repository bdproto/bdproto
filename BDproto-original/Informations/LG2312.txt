Language name: KHMU?

Language number: 2312

Alternate names: Kammu

Classification: Austro-Asiatic, Palaungic

Comments:
Khmu? is spoken in Burma, Laos, Thailand, Vietman and China. (Northern) Khmu? has a two-level tone system. Aspirated plosives might be interpreted as Ch clusters (Svantesson's 'deep phonology' does so) but only a few words provide clear motivation for such an interpretation.
