Comments:
Main dialect.  Pohnpeian is spoken in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia.  A higher mid front vowel [e] occurs when a high vowel or glide follows in underlying forms.  Surface contrasts arise with the lower mid front vowel (Rehg 1984).  All vowels can appear long, often as a result of compensatory lengthening.
