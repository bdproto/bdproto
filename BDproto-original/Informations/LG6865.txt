Comments:
Trumai is spoken in the upper Xingu basin, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Stress is on the ultimate syllable of a root but is displaced onto a monosyllabic suffix. Nasals occur both voiced and voiceless but not contrastively, however the bilabial is reported to be much more frquently voiceless than the dental one.
