Comments:
Tym dialect.  Selkup is spoken in Siberia in an area south of the Khatanga Gulf.  The source is an interpretation of older sources by Katz and may be incomplete.  Several aspects of the transcription are obscure.  Katz recognizes a set of labialized consonants which are omitted from UPSID.  They could be analyzed as C + w.
