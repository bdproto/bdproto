Comments:
Garawa is spoken in the northeast of Northern Territory and an adjoining area of Queensland. The segments labelled palatal stop and nasal in UPSID are described as "lamino-velar" by Furby (1974). They have lengthened vowels with an [-i] offglide preceding them and do not occur word-initially.  A considerable number of medial consonant clusters occur.  Vowels have considerable allophonic variation.  Stress falls on the first syllable of the (phonological) word.
