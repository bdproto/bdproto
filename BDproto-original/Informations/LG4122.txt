Language name: Amo

Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Plateau

Comments:
Di Luzio (1972) reports a two-level tone system with rising and falling combinations.  Anderson (1980) notes downstep, and "extra high" on a few items.  A larger vowel inventory than either author reports is assumed on the basis of field work by L. Hyman and analysis of tape recordings.
