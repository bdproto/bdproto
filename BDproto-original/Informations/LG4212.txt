Language name: NERA

Language number: 4212

Alternate names: 

Classification: Nilo-Saharan, E. Sudanic

Comments:
All vowels also occur long, and gemination of consonants is distinctive.  "At least two significant tones occur" (Thompson).  Voiced prenasalized stops occur and velars also occur labialized.  Thompson treats these as sequences but does not provide a reasoning.  Bender (1968) notes that these are among a longer list of word-medial clusters.
