Comments:
Konkani is spoken in Goa, Southern Kannada and parts of Mysore (?). The version represented here is essentially that in Madtha (1984). Other accounts of the language include sets of voiceless and voiced aspirates which appear to be spelling pronunciations, though /f/ often reflects orthographic 'ph'. All vowels have long counterparts. Stress is usually initial.
