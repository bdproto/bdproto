Classification: Austro-Tai, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian

Comments:
Fruata dialect.  Irarutu is spoken in the center of the Bomberai peninsula, Irian Jaya, Indonesia. Voorhoeve (1989) reports that "stress is phonemic" but "usually is on the last vowel" of a word.  A /p/ occurs only in a few clearly recognizable Indonesian loans, hence is not included in the inventory.  A predictable schwa vowel occurs after utterance-final consonants and between adjoining consonants not separated by a lexical vowel. Prenasalized stops or the bilabial fricative before /r/ do not require insertion of schwa.
