Language name: EWONDO

Language number: 4141

Alternate names: 

Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Bantoid

Comments:
Ewondo has 3 level tones. The high vowels /i,u/ are "so high...that loud friction usually occurs with these vowels" (Redden 1979: 8). Prenasalized obstruents contrast with syllabic nasal + C sequences and according to Nnomo and Mbezele syllable boundary falls before them. The intuition of these native speakers that these are single segments is followed here.
