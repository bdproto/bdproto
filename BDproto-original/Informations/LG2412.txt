Comments:
Sama is spoken in the Capul Island near San Bernadino Strait, northwest Samar in the phillipines.All vowels except schwa occur long and short and all consonants except /h/ and /?/ may appear geminate. Long vowels do not occur before geminates.  Since prenasalized consonants can be geminated and permit a long vowel to precede they are treated as single consonants. Verheijen's final diphthongs /ai,au/ are interpreted as /aj,aw/.
