Comments:
Andoke is spoken in the upper Amazon basin in Colombia. Landaburu analyses it as a tone language with two level tones. Nasalized vowels occur word-initially, but elsewhere only after nasal consonants. Consequently nasals can be analyzed as allohpones of voiced stops. The sounds represented as palato-alveolar affricates here apparently vary considerably from (palatal) plosives, to (postalveolar) affricates, to [s] and [j] for voiceless and voiced cases respectively. Syllables may be closed by a glottal stop - Landaburu treats this as a feature of the vowels.
