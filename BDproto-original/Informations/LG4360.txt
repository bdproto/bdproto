Language name: IRAQW

Language number: 4360

Alternate names: 

Classification: Afro-Asiatic, Cushitic

Comments:
Whitely implies that the voiced implosives may be contrastive morphophonologically but Chris Ehret (p.c.) considers them as free variants of voiced plosives. Non-low central vowels may be derived, leaving a five-vowel long/short basic system.  Iraqw probably has a two-level tone system.
