Comments:
Yanyuwa is spoken mainly at or near Borroloola, Northern Territory, Australia. The series of consonants described here as palatalized velars are called palato-velar by Kirton and Charlie (1978). They arose historically through coalescence of clusters of palato-alveolar and velar consonants. Almost all remaining clusters consist of a sequence of a coronal and a 'peripheral' (bilabial or velar), so an analysis of these as clusters would be defensible (Huttar and Kirton, 1981). The velar and palatalized velar series do not contrast between high front vowels. Stops are said to vary in voicing with a tendency for "voicing to be more frequent between vowels and at the onset of a stressed syllable in word-medial position" (Kirton 1967:18). However, a tape recording of one Yanyuwa speaker showed voiceless stops even in these positions. Kirton and Charlie (1978) note that for prenasalized stops in word-initial position "the nasal onset of the complex phoneme is voiceless in almost every occurrence". This is taken as an indication that the prenasalized stops are also basically voiceless. /a/ is the most common vowel; the sequence /aa/ is disyllabic and no other vowel sequences occur.
