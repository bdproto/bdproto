Comments:
Western dialect.  W. Bruu is spoken in areas of Savannehkhet province, Laos and Ubon Rachathani province, Thailand.  The 'register' distinction between plain and breathy voice quality is localized in the vowels in this interpretation.  Aspirated or voiced stops do not occur before breathy vowels, neither does /s/.  The inital ("minor") syllable of disyllabic words does not have plain/breathy contrast.  Vowels are nasalized rather than breathy in phonologically "breathy" syllables after /h/ and /?/.
