Classification: N. American, Almosan

Comments:
Upper Chehalis was formerly spoken in an area of South-western Washington state, U.S.A. Vowel length is phonemic. There may be a series of contrastively laryngealized nasals and approximants, but Kinkade's (1963) subject was not consistent in using them.
