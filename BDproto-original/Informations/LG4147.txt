Comments:
Uzere dialect. Isoko is spoken around the town of Oleh in Bendel State, Nigeria. Isoko has two level tones; final L is raised in affirmative declaratives. The vowels /i,e,o,u/ belong to one harmony set (+ATR) in opposition to the remainder. A word must have vowels from one set or the other, except that /a/ may appear in prefixes before [+ATR] vowels. Clusters with the flap occur, including h + flap r which has been interpreted as a voiceless flap by others. Breathy voiced 'v' is tending to lose its distinctive phonation and merge with /v/.
