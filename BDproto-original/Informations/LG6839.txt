Comments:
Payne states that /p, m/ are often labialized [pw, mw] and /m, n/ are prenasalized stops before oral vowels. It is not clear if this means that [mbw] is normally found. On the assumption that prenasalization is optional the nasal segments are anayzed as nasal /m, n/. Yagua has basically a two-level tone system. Other analyses suggest the mid vowels might be derived from vowel coalescence, Payne describes these as phonemes with defective distribution.
