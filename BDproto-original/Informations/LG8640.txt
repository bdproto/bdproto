Comments:
Dumo dialect. Vanimo is spoken in an area on the northern coast of Papua New Guinea near the Irian Jaya border. Ross (1980) describes it as having 3 "tones": "high", "long", and "toneless". Long tone is apparently not perceptibly longer "because Vanimo has strict syllable-timing" but it has a mid onset. The palato-alveolar stop has affricate and approximant variants. Ross considers it posible that nasalized vowels could be allophonic but conditioning is not understood.
