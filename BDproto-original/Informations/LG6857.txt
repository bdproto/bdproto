Comments:
Cuna is spoken on San Blas Island, Panama, and on the Caribbean coast astride the Panama/Colombia border. All vowels may occur long.  The voiceless stops and the affricate are, from a morphological point of view, geminates.  Other consonants, except /w/, actually occur geminated.  Syllable canon is (C)V(C), i.e. no more than two adjacent medial consonants can occur.
