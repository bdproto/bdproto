Language name: Shilha

Language number: 4356

Alternate names: 

Classification: Afro-Asiatic, Berber

Comments:
The pharyngealized dental/alveolar consonants are described as "domal".  Applegate posits an element /:/ which adds "tension" to a preceding consonant and shortens the preceding vowel.  Other analyses would treat this as gemination.  All consonants except perhaps /9,w,j/ seem to occur geminate.
