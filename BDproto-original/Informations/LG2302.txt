Comments:
Khasi is spoken in Assam, Khasi-Jaintia Hills, Jammu, Kashmir, Manipur, Punjba, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal in India and also in Bangaldesh. All vowels occur short and long but long vowels are limited in distribution.  /ia/ patterns like a short vowel, /ie, uo/ like long vowels.  Final /w/ and /j/ exclude any other final consonant and hence are treated as consonantal offglides rather than as constituents of diphthongs.
