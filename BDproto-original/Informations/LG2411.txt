Comments:
Cham is spoken mostly in Kampuchea but there are several speakers in Vietnam. Retroflex stops and fricatives occur and are interpreted by Blood (1967) as clusters of alveolars with /r/ even though the main allophone of /r/ is an alveolar flap. However, other obstruents occur in clusters with /r/ and there is a gap for /tr/ etc. Laryngealized /b,d/ vary with plain voiced [b,d]. Cham has a two-level tone system.
