Comments:
Rutul is spoken in the Upper Samur river basin in the Dagestan ASSR and in adjoining areas of Azerbaijan, USSR. Ibragimov (1978) argues for pharyngealization as a feature of uvular and laryngeal consonants, rather than positing a set of pharyngealized vowels (cf. Dzhejranishvili 1967) which would be contrastive only in the context of uvulars. However his "pharyngealized laryngeals" have been interpreted as primary pharyngeal consonants. Labialized sibilant fricatives and affricates are rare but seem authentic. The missing cases (eg. dzw) may well be gaps in the data rather than absent from the language.
