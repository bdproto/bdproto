Language name: SHUSWAP

Language number: 6778

Alternate names: 

Classification: N. American, Almosan

Comments:
Spoken by older people in an area of southcentral British Columbia, Canada. Schwa only appears in unstressed syllables. Kuipers (1974) notes that "in the glottalic obstruents glottal and release are simultaneous", hence these are not interpreted as ejective or implosive.
