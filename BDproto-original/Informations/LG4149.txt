Comments:
Ndut is spoken in Mont-Rolland, northwest of Thies in Senegal. The language appears to have 3 level tones. Consonant inventory has been inferred from the examples cited in Gueye (1986); some contrasts might have been missed. Velar and dental/alveolar prenasalized stops are assumed to occur although no examples are cited. The vowel system opposes [+ATR] i, e, u and schwa to the remainging [-ATR] vowels.
