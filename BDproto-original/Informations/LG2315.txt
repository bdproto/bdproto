Comments:
Nyah Kur is spoken in Thailand in some communities along the eastern margin of the Central Plain (Chao Praya basin). It has a "register" system involving primarily phonation contrasts, represented here as a plain/breathy distinction in vowels. All vowels may appear long and short. A final consonant described by Diffloth (1984) as "an s-like sound" and transcribed as a voiceless palatal approximant has been interpreted as a palatal fricative. Thongkum (1984) transcribes it as a devoiced palatal stop, but it contrasts with /-c/.
