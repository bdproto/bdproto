Comments:
Voiced stops have prenasalized variants utterance initially or following a nasalized vowel. Preceding a nasalized vowel they are nasal consonants (/b/->[m], etc.). The vowels /e,o,a/ are all classed as "low" but on the basis of symbols chosen it is assumed /e,o/ are mid vowels. Cubeo has two level tones and stress, which may only fall on a high-tone syllable.
