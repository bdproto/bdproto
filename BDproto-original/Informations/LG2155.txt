Language name: SAAMI

Language number: 2155

Alternate names: Lappish

Classification: Ural-Altaic, Finno-Ugric, Finnic

Comments:
There are complex interrelations between vowels and consonants.  Long and diphthongal realizations of vowels appear to be predictable if palatalization of consonants is taken as distinctive.  Consonants can appear geminate and in many clusters, particularly with /h/.  The Southern dialect described by Hassselbrink (1965) has been interpreted in the light of the more phonetically detailed but less phonological description of an Eastern dialect by Kert (1971).
