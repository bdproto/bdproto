Comments:
Fe?fe? is spoken in the Haut-Nkam department of Cameroun. The inventory given corresponds to the underlying segments proposed by Hyman (1972). Voiced stops only appear as such following nasal prefixes; elsewhere they are voiceless stops or voiced sonorants (/d/->[l]). Vowels have generally more open variants in closed syllables. As with segments, the tones of Fe?fe? show considerable surface variation which can be reduced to a small number of underlying contrast, essentially high and low levels.
