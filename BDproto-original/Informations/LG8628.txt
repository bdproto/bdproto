Classification: Papuan, Trans-New Guinea

Comments:
Wahgi is spoken in the Central Highlands of Papua New Guinea. It is analyzed as having word-level high, low and rising tone patterns and also stress (Phillips 1976). The i/I contrast seems marginal and may depend on tone. Laterals do not occur word-initially and are voiceless fricatives or affricates finally; Phillips reports them as varying with voiced fricatives medially. Ladefoged, Cochran and Disner (1977) report voiced lateral approximants in medial position.
