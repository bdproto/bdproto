Comments:
Western dialect.  Ejagham is spoken in an area along the Nigeria-Cameroon border near Ikom.  There are three level tones and three contours (high-low, high-mid, low-high), at least on the surface.  There are few roots with contrast of /d/ and flap /r/, or /b/ and bilabial fricative; usually these are predictable variants.
