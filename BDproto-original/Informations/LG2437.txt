Language name: TETUN

Language number: 2437

Alternate names: Timorese

Classification: Austro-Tai, Central Malayo-Polynesian

Comments:
Tetun is spoken on the island of Timor around Dili and in two separate areas to the east and west. Morris (1984) is a linguistically unsophisticated source with some especially confusing remarks about vowel sequences. More sequences occur in the dictionary than are listed in the introduction; probably all pairs of vowels occur. /w/ might be analyzed as a prevocalic variant of /u/, as Morris proposes, but there is no parallel to this with /i/. Stress is normally penultimate except a few items stressed on the final syllable.
