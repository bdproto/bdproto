Comments:
Murinhpatha is still spoken by a substantial community mainly at Wadeye (Port Keats), Northern Territory, Australia. Street and Mollinjin's articulatory diagrams show that the dental series is interdental before non-front vowels /a,U/ but laminal post-alveolar (with tongue tip behind the lower teeth) before front vowels. This distribution seems to argue for this series being underlying dental, rather than being (lamino-)palatal as they suggest.  The palatal variant is thus due to a front vowel position.  However, this does not account for palatal variants occurring in syllable-final position. Retroflex consonants do not occur word-initially.  /j/ occurs word-finally after vowels other than /i/.  Primary stress is normally on the first syllable, with alternating stresses on subsequent syllables.
