Language name: KOYA

Language number: 2905

Alternate names: 

Classification: Dravidian, Dravidian

Comments:
Gommu dialect.  All consonants except /h/ occur geminate and all vowels appear long and short.  The retroflex consonants are not the sublaminal type found most commonly in Dravidian languages but are apical postalveolar.  Tyler's vowel descriptions seem sometimes at variance with the choice of symbols for transcription: the low back vowel might be rounded.
