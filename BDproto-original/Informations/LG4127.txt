Language name: TEKE

Language number: 4127

Alternate names: Kukuya

Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Bantoid

Comments:
Stops and affricates also occur prenasalized but many of these occurrences result from prefixation, so all are analyzed as biphonemic; /g/ only occurs with a preceding nasal.  The highest vowels /i, u/ occur distinctively only as first vowel in a CVV sequence and introduce fricative transitions on the preceding C.
