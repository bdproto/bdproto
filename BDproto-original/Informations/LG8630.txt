Comments:
Usan is spoken in the Adelbert Ranges, Madang Province, Papua New Guinea. Plain and prenasalized voiced plosives only contrast in medial and final position., /d/ is [d] initially but an alveolar flap elsewhere. A considerable number of vowel sequences "with one mora timing" occur; these are interpreted nonetheless as vowel sequences.
