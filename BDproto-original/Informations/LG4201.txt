Language name: KANURI

Language number: 4201

Alternate names: 

Classification: Nilo-Saharan, Saharan

Comments:
Kanuri has a two-level tone system.  Hutchison lists prenasalized stops as unit phonemes but does not justify this assumption, however Awoboluyi gives an example suggesting that closed syllable allophones of mid vowels appear before N + C clusters.
