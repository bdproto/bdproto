BDPROTO is a database of phonological inventories from ancient and reconstructed languages. The aggregated phonological inventory data and associated metadata is available in a flat CSV file in this directory named [bdproto.csv](bdproto.csv). Bibliographic references for data points are available in the [sources.bib](sources.bib) file.

BDPROTO 1.0 is described in:

* Marsico, Egidio, Sebastien Flavier, Annemarie Verkerk and Steven Moran. 2018. BDPROTO: A Database of Phonological Inventories from Ancient and Reconstructed Languages. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), 1654-1658. May 7-12, Miyazaki, Japan. Online: [http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2018/pdf/534.pdf](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2018/pdf/534.pdf).

An expanded version, BDPROTO 1.1, is described in:

Online:  [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-019-09483-3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-019-09483-3).

The BDPROTO data are available under the [Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International](https://github.com/bdproto/bdproto/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) license. If you use the BDPROTO data in your research, it is recommended that you make use of the most recent release in your own analyses. We archive each release of BDPROTO in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3521639).

The original source data (and project name) come from:

* Marsico, Egidio. 1999. What can a database of proto-languages tell us about the last 10,000 years of sound changes. In Proceedings of the XIVth International Congress of Phonetic Sciences (ICPhS99), 353-356. Online: [https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/icphs-proceedings/ICPhS1999/papers/p14_0353.pdf](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/icphs-proceedings/ICPhS1999/papers/p14_0353.pdf)

This legacy resource was converted into Unicode UTF-8 using principles defined in [Moran & Cysouw, 2018](https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/176) and according to the [PHOIBLE Unicode IPA conventions](https://phoible.org/conventions). 

The original BDPROTO data is available in various formats along with the extraction and transformation scripts at: [https://github.com/bdproto/bdproto-legacy](https://github.com/bdproto/bdproto-legacy). BDPROTO-legacy contains a convenience sample aimed at genealogical diversity and it contains no duplicate inventories for a given reconstruction.

Three additional resources have been compiled to update and extend the coverage of the original BDPROTO sample. These include the raw data in the [src](src) directory for the three resources:

* [ancient-near-east](src/ancient-near-east)
* [uz](src/uz)
* [huji](src/huji)

These data points contain more recent reconstructions, which in some cases introduces more than one inventory for a given reconstruction.

The `ancient-near-east` inventories were collected as part of a project on ancient Near East languages at the Department of Comparative Linguistics at the University of Zurich. Additional inventories were also extracted from source references at the Department of Comparative Linguistics (we simply call this source `uz`). Work by The Hebrew University of Jerusalem includes phonological inventories from recent publications. This source is labeled `huji`.

For all of the data sources, we have gathered additional metadata (when available) including identifying information such as [Glottolog](https://glottolog.org/) codes and information about estimated time-depths, possible homelands, etc. 

The phonological inventory data from the various raw input sources and their metadata are aggregated into a single flat-file table.

We have also collected and curated references for each data point and these are available in the [sources.bib](sources.bib) file.

Inferred geo-coordinates for homelands, when available, come from:

Preliminary studies based on BDPROTO have been presented at the following conferences:

The data in this repository contain the development version, i.e., we continue to add, edit, and refine BDPROTO. We are also making the BDPROTO data available in the [Cross-Linguistic Data Format](https://cldf.clld.org) here:

And a website is forthcoming.
