Comments:
Southern Ivatan dialect.  Ivatan is spoken  on the islands of the Batanes province of the Philippines relatively close to Taiwan. The palato-alveolar segments historically derive from velars and are mostly still found before /i/ where velars do not occur. If an underlying /i/ is posited for the remaining cases these segments can be eliminated.
