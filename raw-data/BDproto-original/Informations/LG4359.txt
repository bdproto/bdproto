Classification: Afro-Asiatic, Cushitic

Comments:
"Length is relevant for consonants, but geminate consonants occur relatively seldom." (Hetzron)  'Ash' can be derived from "a palatal element and /a/ at a morpheme boundary" but some forms are fossilized and can be cited to justify the 6-vowel analysis.  Probably tonal.
