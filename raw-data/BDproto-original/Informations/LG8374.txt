Comments:
Ngarinjin is spoken in the Northern Kimberley Ranges of northern Western Australia. Coate and Elkin's description of sounds is often variable: the palatals are labeled "palato-dental" (except "alveolar" /j/) on the consonant chart but just as palatals when listed individually; /l/ is "alveolar" on the chart but "alveo-velar" in the list. Symbols for plosives suggest voiced segments, but they are defined as voiceless. Vowels apparently may appear long. A high central vowel is added to the five vowels given by Coates and Elkin on the basis of a remark that this vowel is heard in some words and is "differentiated by some linguists in Ngarinjin".
