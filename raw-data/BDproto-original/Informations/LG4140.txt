Comments:
Gwari has 3 level tones.  Hyman and Magaji note that "one distinctive characteristic of all Gwari dialects is the presence of consonant + nasal clusters".  An alternative would be to posit 3 nasalized vowels, but H & M's analysis is accepted here, since C + N + /a/ is realized as consonant + nasal release + oral vowel [a]. High vowels /i,u/ after C + N are phonetically nasalized, and C + N + /i/ only has a phonetic nasal consonant segment if C is bilabial or velar.  A loose end is a grammatical particle (orthographic 'in') which is a nasalized vowel only.  /t,d,s,z/ are palato-alveolar affricates and fricatives before front vowels or /j/.  /n/ is palatal before /j/ and velar before /w/.
