Classification: Afro-Asiatic, Chadic

Comments:
Lame is spoken in Benoue Department of Cameroon along the Chad border. Non-high vowels have a rounded schwa variant in initial syllables of some disyllables and reduplicated forms.  Vowels are nasalized before velar nasal and the nasal is dropped in some forms. Sachnine (1982) suggests positing a series of nasalized vowels. There are 3 level tones, but strong dependence between initial consonants and tone in verbal forms.  Intervocalic voicing of obstruents is strongly influenced by initial voicing.
