Comments:
Jacaltec is spoken in the Huehuetenango department of Guatemala near the Mexican border. Loanwords from Spanish may add /b,d,g,x/ to the segments listed here.  The implosive segments listed here appear to be variably implosive or ejective -- the only indication of voicing is the choice of symbol.
