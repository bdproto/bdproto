Classification: Afro-Asiatic, Chadic 

Comments:
In open syllables there is a contrast between long and short vowels. Ebert notes ten words with nasalized vowels. We have interpreted these as having a palatal nasal -- medially this varies with nasalized /j/, finally it is lost leaving a nasalized vowel. Kera has 3 level tones and glides composed of their combination. There is a strong interrelationship between tone level and obstruent consonant voicing (laryngealized stops go with voiceless ones).
