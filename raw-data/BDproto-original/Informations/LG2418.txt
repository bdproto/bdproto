Comments:
Tsou is spoken on the western side of Mt. Ali in Taiwan.  Vowel sequences are common but can be analyzed as heterosyllabic.  Stress generally falls on the penultimate syllable.  The laryngealized segments are described as "preglottalized"; the laryngealized lateral is distinct from the sequence /?l/ but /?b/ is not reported by Tung (1964).
