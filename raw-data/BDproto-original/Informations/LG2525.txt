Comments:
Lijiang dialect.  Naxi is spoken in Northwestern Yunnan, China, primarily around Lijiang.  The fricative vowel contrasts with /u/; it has a bilabial trill allophone after bilabial consonants.  High vowels /i,u,y/ occur before a number of non-high vowels; the 11 resulting sequences might be regarded as diphthongs.  Naxi has 4 tones, high, mid, low rising, and low falling.  Bradley (1975) suggests that the rising tone only occurs in loan vocabulary.
