Comments:
Boumaa dialect. Boumaa Fijian is spoken around 'Orovou on Taveuni, Fiji. All vowels may occur long.  Long vowels and diphthongs attract stress; primary stress goes on the syllable containing the penultimate mora in Dixon's formulation.  /k/ occurs in loans from Standard Fijian, Tongan, and English; /f/ in loans from English and Tongan.
