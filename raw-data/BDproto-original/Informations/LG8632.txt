Comments:
Yessan-Mayo is spoken upriver from Ambunti, East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea. Stress is initial except when /a/ occurs in a subsequent syllable and attracts stress to that syllable. Vowel allophones are very variable. Rounded allophones of central vowels occur before and after /w/ and after labialized velars. Fronted allophones occur contiguous to /i/ and, often, with bilabials.
