Language name: TIWI

Language number: 8351

Classification: Australian, ungrouped

Comments:
Retroflex consonants (except the rhotic) do not occur initially.  Lee (1984) suggests that labialization of consonants can be predicted from occurrence of the vowel /o/.  Other analyses have proposed distinctive labialized bilabial and velar consonants.
