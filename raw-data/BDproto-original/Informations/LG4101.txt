Language name: Moro

Language number: 4101

Alternate names: 

Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Kordofanian

Comments:
The Blacks consider a number of syllable-initial nasal+stop and liquid+stop clusters to be unit phonemes. Voiced dental and retroflex stops seem to be limited to occurrence in these clusters.  Schadeberg treats [6D] as an allophone of /dD/.
