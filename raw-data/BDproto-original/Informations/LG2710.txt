Comments:
Itelmen is spoken by some older speakers on the west coast of the Kamchatka peninsula, USSR.  Volodin (1976) describes a limited vowel harmony system based on height, /i,u/ -> /e,o/ and /e/ -> /a/ when a low(er) vowel follows.  Glottal stop is largely found at morpheme boundaries.  Several phonetic descriptions are vague; /a/ may be central or front, the lateral fricatives might not be actually fricative, the alveolar ejective affricate might be be palato-alveolar (it is described as contrasting with /tS/ by being non-palatalized).
