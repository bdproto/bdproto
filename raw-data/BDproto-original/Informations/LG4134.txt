Language name: AGHEM

Language number: 4134

Alternate names: 

Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Bantoid

Comments:
Aghem has two level tones.  A falling tone is derived when high spreads to a following low tone syllable.  Long vowels and diphthongs seem best treated as vowel sequences.  They carry a single tone but often derive from affixation or loss of intervocalic consonants. Phonetic [p] is analyzed as the allophone of /kp/ before [u].
