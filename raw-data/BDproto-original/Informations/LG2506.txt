Comments:
Bai is spoken primarily in the Dali Bai autonomous county in western Yunnan, China.  Dell (1981) notes 8 tones: high, mid and low level, high falling and low falling, mid rising and low fall-rise -- the 8th tone is very high with a final glottal stop which shortens the vowel.  Since no initial glottal stops occur this feature is analyzed as part of an extra high tone.  There are no final consonants.  /j,w/ can appear after some consonants, as well as initially.  /w/ has a labial-palatal variant before /i/.  The labio-dental fricative vowel does not occur after bilabials.
