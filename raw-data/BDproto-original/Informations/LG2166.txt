Language name: Khalkha

Language number: 2166

Alternate names: Mongolian

Classification: Ural-Altaic, Mongolian

Comments:
Khalkha is spoken primarily in Mongolia People's Republic but there are few speakers in USSR. All simple vowels appear both long and short. Khalkha Mongolian has a vowel harmony system probably based on pharyngeal cavity size (Svantesson 1985).  /i, u, e, o/ have expanded pharynx ([+ATR]), though /i/ is neutral to vowel harmony in non-initial syllables. /g/ and /x/ are treated as allophones by Hangin (1968).  Treatment of diphthongs is varied in sources.
