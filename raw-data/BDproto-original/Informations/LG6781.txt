Comments:
North Carolina dialect.  Cherokee is spoken in parts of eastern  Oklahoma and also in western North Carolina. Clusters of /h/ + voiced consonant are phonetically voiceless counterparts of the voiced C. Such clusters often arise from a metathesis process switching /h, ?/ and a resonant. A more superficial account might posit a whole set of voiceless consonants.
