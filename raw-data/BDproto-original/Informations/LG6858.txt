Comments:
Maxakali is spoken in northeastern Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Prenasalized stops, except the velar one, lose their stop component before nasalized vowels. The voiceless affricate is often just a fricative. Syllable-final consonants can be replaced by a "cognate vowel" especially when followed by a homorganic consonant.
