Alternate names: 

Classification: Papuan, Trans-New Guinea

Comments:
Waris is spoken in Amanab District, West Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, and adjoining areas of Irian Jaya, Indonesia. Brown (1988) provides only a list of phoneme symbols with few definitions. /a/ is described as low front but seems more likely to be central as there are two other vowels in the lower front region.
