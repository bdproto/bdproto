Comments:
Bella Coola is spoken by perhaps 75 remaining fluent speakers in Bella Coola on the central coast of British Columbia. Reduplication rules that copy a single consonant clarify that the ejectives and affricates listed are not clusters. High vowels alternate with /w,j/. Syllabic instances of /m,n,l/ (phonetically shwa before sonorant) are largely predictable from phonological and morphological context.
