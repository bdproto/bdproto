Comments:
Kiowa is spoken by a few hundred speakers in south-central Oklahoma. Long and short variants of vowels occur, with many alternations predictable from syllable structure (Long in open, short in closed syllables). Kiowa has high and low tones and a HL combination that occurs only on heavy syllables (containing a long vowel, a diphthong or a vowel + sonorant sequence). HL is accompanied by significant glottalization. /dl/ does not occur initially; medially it is [l]. Dental and alveolar obstruents do not occur before /i/; velars and /j/ do not occur before /e/. A palatal glide is clearly heard between a velar and front /a/.
