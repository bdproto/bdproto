Alternate names: Jicaque

Classification: N. American, Hokan

Comments:
Tol is spoken by a few hundred people in the Francisco Morazon department of Honduras.  Fleming & Dennis (1977) recognize a segment described as a central semivowel (velar approximant?) which occurs only as an infix.  This seems likely to be considered an allophone either of the corresponding vowel or one of the other approximants.  Glottalized stops occur with laryngealized vowels in the same syllable -- an alternative analysis might posit laryngealized vowels but it appears that syllable-initial and syllable-final glottalized stops need to be distinguished.
