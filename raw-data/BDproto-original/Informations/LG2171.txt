Comments:
Japanese is spoken primarily in Japan. All vowels may appear long, as may all obstruents  - long vowels accent placement may be on either element.  Shibatani (1990) reports final nasals as uvulars, varying with the nasalized counterpart of the preceding vowel.  /t, d, s, z/ are replaced by palato-alveolar affricates or fricatives before /i, e/. /t, d/ are [ts, dz] before /u/.  Some analyses regard these sibilant variants as phonemic because of a residue of problematic cases.  Bloch (1950) and Horne (1963) both report that /t, d, n, s/ are dental before /a/; this variant is taken as underlying.
