Comments:
Alamblak is spoken along the Wagupmeri and Karawari rivers, E. Sepik province, Papua New Guinea. Palato-alveolar consonants often arise from blending of an alveolar + preceding or following /j/. Nonsibilant fricatives are voiced between voiced segments, except when a nasal precedes. An analysis of the vowel system as containing only 3 central vowels, with front and back variants conditioned by adjacent approximants /j/, /w/ is discussed by Bruce (1984). However there are several problems with this analysis, e.g. [i] from abstract high central vowel + /j/ would be expected to palatalize a following /t/ but doesn't.
