Comments:
Vowel length may be largely predictable. Garbell describes a contrast between 'flat' and 'plain' words and syllables.  In 'flat' items all consonants are, inter alia, pharyngealized.  This has been interpreted as a vowel-harmony type of process with pharyngealization as a contrastive property of vowels.
