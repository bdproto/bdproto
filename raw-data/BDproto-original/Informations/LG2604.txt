Comments:
Bats is spoken in the Akhmetsk region of northern Georgia, USSR. Nasalized vowels only occur in a few inflectional endings but contrast with vowel + nasal. Desheriev (1953) also notes 3 long vowels but at least some examples are clearly just juxtapositions of two separate vowels. Similarly the diphthongs he reports seem to be a sequence of two adjacent vowels. Especially restricted are the "nasalized diphthongs" which all end in nasalized 'i' and occur only in inflectional endings.
