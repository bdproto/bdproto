Language name: KANAKURU

Language number: 4370

Alternate names: 

Classification: Afro-Asiatic, Chadic

Comments:
Kanakuru has a two level tone system, with somewhat limited contrastive function. Newman recognizes 7 additional labialized consonant phonemes.  As these are apparently identical to Cw sequences that are derived in Cui and Coi syllables they are interpreted as sequences here.
