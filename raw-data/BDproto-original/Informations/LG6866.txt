Classification: South American, Equatorial

Comments:
Ache is spoken by a very small group of surviving speakers in the Alta Pou reservation, Alto Parana, Paraguay. Susnik's description is quite unorthodox and leaves somewhat unclear exactly what consonants and vowels are contrastive. In particular nasalized vowels seem often predictable if prenasalized stops and /m/ are assumed to be underlying. However, the analysis adopted here assumes that they are contrastive because a few are cited in words with voiceless stops. On the other hand [n] is taken to be an allophone of the lateral flap.
