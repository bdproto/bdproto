Comments:
Vietnamese is spoken primarily in Vietnam. Vietnamese (of Hanoi) has six tones distinguished by level, contour and laryngeal features.  /p/ only occurs finally and can be analyzed as an allophone of implosive /b/, but no general rule that voiced initials pair with voiceless final stops can be formulated.  Vowels in open syllables are followed by a consonantal offglide (/j/ after /i, e/ etc.).  /j, w/ can follow most vowels, when no other consonant may appear, but some final consonants can follow the diphthongs with a low final element.
