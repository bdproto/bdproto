Comments:
Toro Soo dialect.  Dogon is spoken in an area straddling the Mali-Burkina Faso border to the east of Mopti.  Higher and lower mid vowels do not co-occur in a stem.  Dogon has been analyzed as a tone language with two level tones but words have only LH or HL basic patterns and the pitch could be predicted from accent.
