Classification: Na-Dene, Eyak

Comments:
Krauss (1965) reported that there were "3 persons capable of serving adequately as informants for Eyak".  Apart from loanwords /m,n/ "could be interpreted as w and l respectively, followed by a nasalized vowel". Short oral vowels are often in free variation, the non-high vowel variation being obscurely described. Krauss includes 'aspiration' and 'glottalization' of vowels as modifications similar to length and nasalization.  Since there are consonants /h,?/, and verb stems in -V:? ("long glottalized nucleus") seem to count as closed, these are interpreted as postvocalic -h and -?.
