Comments:
Sedang is spoken in Gia Lai-Cong Tum Province in Vietnam. Smith reports highly restricted nasalized vowels, after /h,?/ only.  There are complex relationships between laryngealization of vowels, allowable final consonants and vowel diphthongization.  In closed syllables, laryngealized vowels occur only before /j,w/ and nasals.  These syllables could be interpreted as terminating with laryngealized consonants, but in open syllables plain and laryngealized vowels contrast and both differ from final -? and -h syllables.
