Comments:
Zhanglu dialect.  Kam is spoken in an area overlapping the shared borders of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces of China.  There are 9 tones in non-checked syllables; 6 of these are level or falling (55, 11, 323, 31, 53, 33).  The other 3 have rising onsets (35, 13, 453) and condition aspiration in stop-initial syllables (including /?/).  Six tones occur in checked syllables, of which two (35, 13) condition aspiration. Checked tones 55, 35, 21 are short and checked tones 323, 13, 31 are long.  The raised low and mid central vowels only occur with a coda (nasal or stop after mid central, nasal or glide after low central).  /j/ occurs after low or back vowels, /w/ after low or front vowels.
