Classification: Chukchi-Kamchatkan

Comments:
Koryak is spoken by a few hundred people on the Kamchatka peninsula in the USSR.  A vowel harmony process requires vowels in a word to belong to set 1 (i,u,e) or set 2 (e,o,a).  Many transcriptions are given with a schwa vowel in Zhukova (1980) but their origin is not explained. Palatal laterals occur before most vowels but are described as "palatalized variants" of /l/.  From the data available they appear contrastive.  All consonants except /?/ can appear geminated.
