Comments:
Lua is spoken along the middle reaches of the Chari river, Chad. Prenasalized stops occur initially in a few words but medially could be allophones of voiced stops after nasalized vowels. Implosives are realized as ? + nasal before nasalized vowels, but oral and nasalized vowels contrast after plosives. Boyeldieu (1985) recognizes complex vowels /wa, ja/ - these are interpreted as vowel sequences /ua,ia/. All vowels except 'barred i' appear long and short.
