Comments:
Kathmandu dialect. Newari is spoken in the Kathmandu valley of Nepal. The reduced vowel inventory proposed by Hale and Hale (1969) has been accepted. Surface vowels of other qualities result from coalescence in vowel sequences. /i, u/ are desyllabified before low vowels, and merge elsewhere.
