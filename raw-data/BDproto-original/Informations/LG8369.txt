Language name: KALKATUNGU

Language number: 8369

Alternate names: 

Classification: Australian, Pama-Nyungan

Comments:
Initially nasal + stop clusters occur; as these are among a larger number of medial clusters such clusters are not treated as prenasalized stops. Stops are "basically voiceless lenis stops", but voicing through coarticulation is normal. There is no initial contrast of alveolar and retroflex.
