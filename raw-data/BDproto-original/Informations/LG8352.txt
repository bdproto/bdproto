Language name: Burarra

Language number: 8352

Alternate names: Burera

Classification: Australian, Burarran

Comments:
Glasgow and Glasgow do not list a retroflex series but note that alveolars "have retroflexed variants ... word initially and in consonant clusters following /r/" (the approximant).  The final and medial consonant clusters make more sense if a retroflex consonant series is assumed (including approximant /r/) which does not occur word-initially.
