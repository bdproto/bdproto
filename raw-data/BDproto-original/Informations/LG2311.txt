Comments:
Brao is spoken in an area of North-Eastern Cambodia and adjoining areas of Laos.  Keller (1976) provides details of the pronunciation of the symbols used in a 'practical orthography' but no other information on the phonology.  Sequences of two like vowels represent long vowels; all may appear long.  Sequences of unlike vowels may be limited but the limits are not specified.  Approximants may follow long vowels.
