Comments:
Phlong is spoken in the Irrawaddy Delta and northern Tenasserim areas of Myanmar (Burma) and in southwestern Chiang Mai, Thailand.  Phlong has four tones on main syllables: high, mid, low and falling.  Syllables with final glottal stop may only have high (which rises in this environment) or falling tone.  Final velar nasal often surfaces as nasalization of the end of the vowel, sometimes with a raised offglide.
