Comments:
"The principal members of the stop phones are voiceless, although there are voiced allophones for all five" (Metcalfe 1971). Retroflex plosives and nasals do not occur word-initially; retroflex /r./ does occur initially but alveolar /r/ doesn't. Establishment of a length contrast in vowels is tentative.
