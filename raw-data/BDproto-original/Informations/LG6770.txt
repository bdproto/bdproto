Comments:
Amuzgo contrasts ballistic and controlled syllables.  Ballistic syllables have sharply falling pitch and amplitude contours.  It also has three level tones and high-low, mid-high and low-mid contour tones. The prenasalized stops are described as occluded (post-stopped) nasals with a "lenis" homorganic stop. They contrast with nasal + stop sequences.  A possible analysis (not among those suggested by Bauernschmidt) is to treat these as allophones of the plain nasals before oral vowels since the oral/nasalized vowel contrast is neutralized after a nasal.  This would mean that a velar nasal would only occur before an oral vowel, so it is not accepted here.  Bilabials and t,n are described as velarized.
