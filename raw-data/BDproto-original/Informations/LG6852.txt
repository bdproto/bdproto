Comments:
Warao is spoken principally along the Venezuelan coast from the Orinoco delta to the Guyana border. Osborn (1966) lists /p/ rather /b/ as the bilabial stop phoneme, but reports that "the voiced allopyhone [b] is heard more frequently than the voiceless [p]". /t/ "has the allophone [t] in all positions". The alveolar lateral flap occurs as [d] word-initially and as a nonlateral flap before /a/ when preceded by /i,a/. Nasalized vowels occur mostly. Nasality spreads from a nasal consonant to all following vowels and glides between the nasal and a following obstruent or word-boundary but a number of words also have unconditioned nasalized vowels.
