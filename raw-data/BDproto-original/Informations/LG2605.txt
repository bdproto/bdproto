Comments:
Archi is spoken in mountainous areas of the southern Dagestan ASSR, in the Soviet Union. Kodzasov (1977) treats pharyngealization as a 'suprasegmental' element which can be focussed on a vowel or a uvular consonant. Particularly in the latter case it seems preferable to treat it as segmental. Originally only velar and uvular consonants (and the long lateral fricative ?) had contrastive labialization but there are now a few words with distinctive labialization on most of the dental/alveolar or palato-alveolar obstruents. The voiced lateral fricative arises from morphological combination of a lateral ejective and a dental/alveolar stop but surface contrasts occur with other laterals.
